# akan-name-generator
## Project Description
The **Akan Name Generator** is a web application that calculates a person’s Akan name based on their birth date and gender. Akan names are derived from the day of the week a person is born in Akan culture, which originates from Ghana. The app validates the input date, calculates the correct day of the week using a mathematical formula, and displays the corresponding Akan name along with its associated traits.

## Behavior-Driven Development (BDD)
The app was designed using Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles, focusing on user-centric behaviors:
Given a user opens the Akan Name Generator web page
When they enter a valid date of birth and select a gender
Then the app calculates the correct day of the week using a formula
And it displays the corresponding Akan name and associated traits
And if the date is invalid or gender is not selected, the app alerts the user
